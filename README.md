## Yorku REST api *for all things York Univesity*

### The problem

I wanted a proper api that I could use to automate tasks.
Help me navigate throguh university, find buildings, libraries and so on.
#### And maybe create an app around it to help other students while at it.

### The solution!
Use Yorku official api, using endpoints they provide but the issue is Yorku doesn't have a proper api, most universities tend to have apis of their own. *Waterloo, I'm looking at you*. anyways that wasn't possible, so I ended up creating my own.


### Who can use it?
Everyone.


### Endpoints
- Food Building database, including open - close time.
- More to come... like courses, their ratings?, study spots, and so on.
